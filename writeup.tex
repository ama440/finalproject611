\caption{Histogram of ages in the dataset. Note that all ages above 80 are recorded as 80, which possibly explains the relatively high count of people in this bin. We should also ask how representative of the population this dataset is, given that the distribution of ages is skewed left. In the general population, the distribution is likely flatter or even skewed right.}
